This are some comments written when I am trying to build the sending the connectionRequst API
<br>
 //firstly we will check whether the userId is created an account or not
 //so we firstly pass for authentication in userAuth
 //if user found that he/she is a member of rgukt_connect will display them profiles
//so how to we find the profiles of senior's from db ? by mailId or id or 
//By ID,By Rgukt Domain Mail id,Year of Studying,Skills
//Here we have checked whether the user a valid guy or not 
//if the guy is verified as valid then the sender can send the request those details will be stored at connectionRequest Schema.
//check that ki you yourself cannot send the connectionRequest
